Brief outline of the project:
    
    1. Create the simulator
        a. Generate the gameboard
        b. Initially remove all pre-made monos
        c. Reconcatenate each individual list with new randomly generated lists
        d. Develop the idea of moves
        e. Apply moves
        f. Repeat until no further moves are possible
        
    2. Test different strategies
    
    3. Compare data from different strategies
    
    4. Work out which strategy is best depending on what you're trying to optimise.
