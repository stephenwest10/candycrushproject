Brief outline of the project:
    
    1. Create the simulator
        a. Generate the gameboard
        b. Initially remove all pre-made monos
        c. Reconcatenate each individual list with new randomly generated lists
        d. Develop the idea of moves
        e. Apply moves
        f. Repeat until no further moves are possible - Done
        
    2. Test different strategies - Need to write more, research sorting in order to play nearer the top
    
    3. Compare data from different strategies - different histograms, different means etc
    
    4. Work out which strategy is best depending on what you're trying to optimise - longer game length higher score? 
        
Theory to look at: 
Ehrenfest model - Markov Chains
Solving a system of the first n first step equations
Calculating transition probabilities from each state
